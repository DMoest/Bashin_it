# Dans ToolKit Scripts - Bashin' it foo sure!

This is intended to improve dev productivity by a lot, or not at all. It up to you and the way 
you intend to use these tools. The idea here is to keep scripting CLI tools from ideas coming up as 
we go. Integrate them in you local CLI environment and use them when ever your instinct tells 
you to.

The dream, no more searchin the ugly stackoverflow site for 
some incompitent dudes answer that holds a negative value of helpfulness, no more slow to open new 
tmux sessions for a project you want to sketch out asap or an old project you have not touched 
in a while. Quick questions answered by the ChatBot or the docs provided by the CheatsSheet.

Script it and run with it!


### The Scripts:
    1. the cheat sheet script, it uses fuzzy finder to traverse a list of added programming 
        languages of your choice. Once you select language you tell it what you want to know. ex.
        in JavaScript asking for 'array splice' tells you how to splice an array with cheat sheet.
    
    2. the tmux session script creates a new session from your selected directory. You add whats 
        your directory and it starts a new session in that directory.
    
    3. the chatbot gpt script, it uses fzf, curl and jq to first select setting and then request 
        answer to the user question.

Please keep in mind, it is not perfect and improvements might need to be made to suit you 
desired workflows. Give it some love and it might get there...


```
Enjoy them scripts!
